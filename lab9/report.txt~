Q1.) We set the chip select pin high/low to decide whether accept and response to the data, which is the property of SPI. High means SPI putting SPI bus. Low means waiting for other data

Q2.) I would replace the loop by calling f3d_delay_uS() function. Timers will be more accurate.

Q3.) DMA can speed the process of reading file, without it the processor can only do one thing at a time
