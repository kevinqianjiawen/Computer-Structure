Q1)
There are 14 pins
1 Vdd_IO Power supply for I/O pins
2 SCL Signal interface I2C serial clock (SCL)
3 SDA Signal interface I2C serial data (SDA)
4 INT2 Inertial Interrupt 2
5 INT1 Inertial Interrupt 1
6 C1 Reserved capacitor connection (C1)
7 GND 0 V supply
8 Reserved Leave unconnected
9 DRDY Data ready
10 Reserved Connect to GND
11 Reserved Connect to GND
12 SETP S/R capacitor connection (C2)
13 SETC S/R capacitor connection (C2)
14 Vdd Power supplyElectrical Characteristics
The accelerometer/magnetometer is from 2.16 ~ 3.6
The accelerometer is located right side of the pins and below the user usb port.

Q2)
To keep receiving and updating the data from accelerometer and the magnetometer.

Q3)
The for loop converts the accelerometer raw data to readable data for human, thus we can understand easily.

Q4)
Tilt compass would be more accurate. Since when the board is tilted, the pitch and roll angle would change.

Difficulties
I am still confused about the calculation of heading. 
And I learned what is pitch, roll and yaw.
