1.Advantage: It's relative easy to check the errors by showing results
  Disadvantage: slow down the system so much

2.spiReadWrite getting what to print on the LCD screen on the machine.
  So, we need a higher level to take use of the informations going through
  the spiReadWrite.

3.LCD_CS_Deassert()
  initialize the machine control, makes rectangles and sets the color.
  It is important because it is a macro to control chip selet and to keep method work.

4.Since ASCII code already defined in the program, and characters are defined as an unsigned 8bit string, from 0 to 255,  So the machine interprets the ASCII code to machine language.

5.fillscreen2 takes about 80 millisenconds and fillscreen takes about 200 milliseconds.
  Instead of sending each individual pixel, the fillscreen2 send an array, so it draws a line at one time.

Difficulties
The function drawpixel is really easy to implement.
But I had really difficult time to figure out how does setAddrWindow and pushcolor works, it seems really easy to push color start from left margin. But when I tried to start from the middle or other position, the result is often out of my expection.
