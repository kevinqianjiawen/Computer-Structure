1.How many connections are required to communicate over UART?
   Four, RX, TX,usb connection and gnd connections.
2.What is the purpose of "alternate functions" for GPIO pins?
   The designer can decide which port is most appropriate given that some pin arrangements are mutually exclusive and prevent the use of the peripheral for other purpo
ses.
3. Define "baud rate" in your own words.
 Baud rate is the speed of transfering data throughout a system. 9600 baud means that the serial port is capable of transferring a maximum of 9600 bits per second.
4.Why do we need newlib_stubs? Specifically, is there a reason that printf won't work on the board without it?
Newlib is to optimize the putchar and printstring version that we made.
This is an embedded toolchain some stub functions known as System Functions must be provided by the embedded system that would normally be provided by a host operating
system.
5.Give an example of a situation in which the Salae Logic Analyzer is the best debugging method and include a screen shot of the Logic application.
  When things seem to be working but we have no idea what is going on in the transferring process between the computer and the microcontroller.
6. I learned different connections to comunicate over UART. And how to test the connection and transfer data.
   difficulties: I have some problem with wc at the first time, then I figured it out, it was the problem associated with the position of 'while' clause.
