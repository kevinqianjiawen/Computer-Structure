Q1) In previous labs, adding a peripheral has required pin initializations. 
Why were able to add the nunchuk without initializing anything?

The nunchuk is a device, a slave to the I2C master. All the initialization is in the i2c src file.


Q2) What are the major differences between these two functions and what does that imply about communicating with the nunchuk?

There's no specification on what byte mode when reading through the nunchuk.


Q3) What do all of these variables correspond to in the nunchuk? Hint: It may be best to answer this question after the checkpoint
jx : joystick's x direction
jy : joystick's y direction
ax, ay, and az are the axes of the accelerometer, used to calculate the 
joystick's z axis
c : a flag for whether the c button is pressed
z : a flag for whether the z button is pressed


Q4) Explain the code below.
Setting z and c to 1 or 0.

Difficulties: We had trouble to make draw gyro work at the beginning, but then we realize was getting stack somewhere, so we move
the initialize of the gyro in the front. Then problem solved.

I learned how to inteprete and manipulate the Nunchuk data.
