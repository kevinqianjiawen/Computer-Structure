1.What does the CS pin do (the CS pin is called SS in the lab manual)?
   The CS (Chip Select) pin is used to enable the correct device for communication.It is used to signal to the slave when a transfer of data is starting and ending.

2.Why do you set the CS high at the end of the pin initializations? What other functions in f3d_gyro.c change CS from low to high or high to low?
 CS is set to high in order to stop the communication of the device which the CS was put to low.
 GYRO_CS_LOW/GYRO_CS_HIGH/f3d_gyro_read/f3d_gyro_write

3.How do you hook up multiple peripherals on one SPI bus?
Initialize the drivers first, and then connet necessary wires.

4.The STM has an Operating Frequency of 72 MHz. When initializing SPI1, what do you set the baud rate prescaler to? What is the resulting SPI clock frequency?
 Baud rate:8 frequency:9

5.Does a peripheral (slave) need to be configured with the transmission speed before it can communicate with the microcontroler (master)? Why would you want to be able to do on-the-fly changes in transmission speed?
 Yes, it need to be configured with the transmission. In order to accomodate different needs of communication.

Difficulties: I had really hard time to figure out how to make the getChar work. Since the while loop in the getchar seems keep the programme there forever. But I figured it out by adding another condition to measure weather we type 'x''y''z'or not in the main.c.

I learned how to combine the functions which we created in ealier labs together.
